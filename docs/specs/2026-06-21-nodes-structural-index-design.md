# nodes — Structural Index (Plan 2) Design

**Status:** approved 2026-06-21
**Builds on:** `docs/specs/2026-06-21-nodes-substrate-design.md` §5 (Derived index & fast I/O)
**Supersedes for §5:** scopes the spec's four-capability "derived index" down to its structural core.

## 1. Purpose & scope

The substrate spec's §5 bundles four independent capabilities under "derived index":
full-text search, the resolved relation graph, alias/slug→id/uid resolution, and an
embedding/similarity store. They have very different dependencies and risk profiles, so they
are split across plans.

**Plan 2 delivers the structural index only** — pure-Python, no external dependencies:

- **Resolution:** `id` / `deprecated_id` → `uid`, O(1), replacing the kernel `Store`'s linear scans.
- **Resolved relations graph:** outbound / inbound queries over the `Relation` primitive.

**Out of scope (later plans):** full-text search (needs a search backend); embeddings/similarity
(needs an embedding model); on-disk persistence of the index; membership-graph *traversal*
queries (tree descendants, DAG reachability); the TypeScript port.

The index remains what the spec promises: a **disposable, fully rebuildable cache** over the
canonical markdown files.

## 2. Architecture & layering

The index is domain-free, so it lives in `nodes.kernel` (the substrate spec lists the derived
index as kernel scope). Two new modules, plus a slimming of the existing `store.py`:

- **`src/nodes/kernel/index.py` — `Index`.** Pure in-memory maps + resolved relation graph.
  Knows nothing about files. Built from a list of `Node`s; supports incremental `upsert` /
  `remove`; answers resolution and graph queries.
- **`src/nodes/kernel/corpus.py` — `Corpus`.** The coordinator and primary public API. Owns a
  `Store` + an `Index`. Every mutation (`add` / `rename` / `delete`) goes through it: collision
  check against the index, the `Store` file op, then the index update.
- **`src/nodes/kernel/store.py` — slimmed.** Reduced to pure file mechanics. The cross-corpus
  logic (`resolve()`'s deprecated scan, `_assert_no_identity_collision`, `rename` +
  `_rewrite_*`, `_id_owner_uid`) **migrates up** into `Corpus` / `Index`. No compatibility shim
  is left behind (greenfield repo, no external consumers).

### Lifecycle

In-memory, incremental. `Corpus(root)` builds the `Store`, scans the corpus once
(`store.all_nodes()`), and builds the `Index`. Thereafter, `Corpus` mutations update the live
index incrementally — no full rebuild per mutation, no disk persistence. The index is always
reconstructable from the files (see §6 invariant).

## 3. `Store` after slimming

`Store` keeps only mechanical, single-file or whole-corpus-scan operations:

```
Store(root: Path)
  .path_for(id) -> Path
  .write_file(node) -> Path          # mechanical write; NO collision check (was _write_file)
  .read_file(id) -> Node             # by path_for(id) only; RefError if no file. NO deprecated scan
  .delete_file(id) -> None           # unlink; RefError if absent
  .all_nodes() -> list[Node]         # corpus scan, used to build/rebuild the Index
```

Removed from `Store` (moved up): `write` (collision), `resolve` (deprecated scan), `read`,
`rename` and `_rewrite_relations` / `_rewrite_membership` / `_rewrite_inbound`,
`_assert_no_identity_collision`, `_claimed_ids`, `_id_owner_uid`.

## 4. `Index`

### What it holds

A lightweight entry per node — **not** the prose body (the body stays sourced from disk via
`Store`, keeping a single source of truth):

```
IndexEntry:
  uid: str
  id: str
  kind: str
  deprecated_ids: frozenset[str]
  out_refs: list[OutRef]             # outbound refs this node points at (see below)
```

Maps:

- `by_uid: dict[str, IndexEntry]`
- `id_to_uid: dict[str, str]`            # live ids
- `deprecated_to_uid: dict[str, str]`    # stale-ref resolution; a live id ALWAYS wins
- `in_refs: dict[str, list[InRef]]`      # reverse map keyed by *referenced id string* (any
                                         #   position that holds an id — see OutRef.role below)

```
InRef:
  source_uid: str          # the node that holds this reference
  out_ref: OutRef          # the specific outbound reference (its role + relation, if any)
```

### Outbound refs — what is indexed vs what is queried

There are two distinct concerns:

1. **Maintenance / reverse-ref tracking (must be complete).** `rename` must rewrite every
   position that holds the old id. The kernel rewrites ids in `node.relations` (both
   `target` **and** `source`), membership `members` (set/list values and dict values), and
   membership `edges` (both `source` **and** `target`). So `out_refs` / `in_refs` track an
   `OutRef` for **each such position** — not just relation targets — enabling O(degree) rename
   instead of an O(corpus) scan. Indexing only the target side would miss, e.g., a graph node
   that names `topic:old` as an *edge source*.
2. **Public graph queries (relations-only).** `outbound()` / `inbound()` expose **`Relation`-primitive
   edges only**, resolved to uids. Membership members/edges are tracked for rename but are **not**
   exposed as public graph edges in Plan 2. Membership traversal is deferred to the layer that
   consumes it.

Each `OutRef` records one referenced id, the structural position (`role`) it occupies, and —
for relation positions — the owning `Relation` so the public graph queries can reconstruct the
edge:

```
OutRef:
  ref: str                 # the referenced id string as written (the in_refs key)
  role: "relation_target" | "relation_source"
       | "membership_member" | "membership_edge_source" | "membership_edge_target"
  relation: Relation | None    # present iff role startswith "relation_"
```

A single `Relation` with an explicit non-container `source` contributes two `OutRef`s (one
`relation_source`, one `relation_target`); a membership edge likewise contributes two.

`OutRef.role` is purely an **indexing/rename detail** — it makes both the rename rewrite and the
public graph queries O(degree). The public queries are defined semantically over **distinct
`Relation` objects**, not over `OutRef` rows (§5), so a relation never appears twice and a
relation whose `source` is a non-container node still attributes correctly.

### Resolution

```
Index.resolve_uid(ref) -> str | None
  # id_to_uid first; then deprecated_to_uid; else None
```

`Corpus` raises `RefError` when this returns `None`.

### Collision

On `upsert`, every claimed id (the live `id` plus each `deprecated_id`) must belong to exactly
one uid. Violations raise `CollisionError` — same semantics as the kernel's
`_assert_no_identity_collision`, enforced via O(1) map lookups:

- a claimed id already mapped to a *different* uid → `CollisionError`;
- a uid already mapped to a *different* live id (the rename-misuse case) → `CollisionError`.

### Maintenance ops

```
Index.build(nodes: Iterable[Node]) -> Index   # classmethod / constructor
Index.upsert(node: Node) -> None              # add or replace; updates all maps + reverse refs
Index.remove(uid: str) -> None                # drop the node's OWN contributions only
```

`upsert` is replace-safe: re-indexing an existing uid first removes its old ref contributions,
then adds the new ones, so the maps never leak stale entries.

`remove(uid)` deletes only what the removed node itself contributed: its `by_uid` entry, its
`id_to_uid` / `deprecated_to_uid` identity claims, and the `in_refs` entries it contributed as a
*source* (its outbound refs). It must **not** drop `in_refs` entries that surviving referrers
contributed pointing *at* the removed node's ids — those references still exist on disk, so
they become **dangling** and must remain visible to `dangling()` and consistent with a fresh
rebuild. (A node's body and identity leave; inbound references to it persist as dangling.)

## 5. `Corpus` — public API

```
Corpus(root: Path)                       # build Store, scan corpus, build Index

  .add(node) -> Node                      # index collision-check; store.write_file; index.upsert
  .get(ref) -> Node                       # index.resolve_uid → live id → store.read_file
  .resolve(ref) -> Node                   # alias of get; RefError if unresolved
  .rename(old_id, new_id) -> Node         # old_id must be a LIVE id (else RefError); collision-check;
                                          #   write new + delete old file; rewrite ONLY the referrers
                                          #   in_refs names (O(degree)); reindex affected nodes
  .delete(id) -> None                     # store.delete_file + index.remove; live-id-only (documented)
  .all() -> list[Node]                    # passthrough to store.all_nodes

  # graph queries — input ref must resolve (live or via deprecated_ids); else RefError:
  .outbound(ref) -> list[ResolvedEdge]    # relations whose source resolves to ref's uid
  .inbound(ref) -> list[ResolvedEdge]     # relations whose target resolves to ref's uid
  .neighbors(ref) -> list[Node]           # distinct resolved neighbors (outbound + inbound)
  .dangling() -> list[ResolvedEdge]       # corpus-wide: relations whose target resolves to no uid
```

```
ResolvedEdge:
  relation: Relation
  source_uid: str
  target_uid: str | None        # None when the target ref is dangling
```

**Graph queries are uid-based and defined over distinct `Relation` objects.** `outbound(ref)`
and `inbound(ref)` first resolve `ref` to a uid (`Index.resolve_uid`); a ref that resolves to no
uid raises `RefError` (distinct from a resolvable node that simply has no edges):

- `outbound(uid)` returns the distinct relations whose `source` resolves to `uid`.
- `inbound(uid)` returns the distinct relations whose `target` resolves to `uid` — merged across
  every written ref that resolves to that uid, so an edge still written as the deprecated
  `topic:old` is included in `inbound("topic:new")`.

Each `ResolvedEdge` re-resolves its endpoints to uids. **Dangling-target semantics:** because
`inbound` is keyed on the *target's* uid, it can only return edges to a node that still
resolves; it cannot (and need not) surface edges to a fully-deleted id. Edges whose target no
longer resolves are surfaced by **`outbound(existing_source)`** (with `target_uid = None`) and
enumerated corpus-wide by **`dangling()`**. A dangling target is never an error.

### `rename` flow (the O(degree) payoff)

1. **`old_id` must be a live id.** If `old_id` is not in `index.id_to_uid` (it is unknown or
   only a deprecated id), raise `RefError` and do nothing — rename is live-id-only, consistent
   with `delete`. This avoids writing a new file while leaving the current live file behind and
   rewriting only the stale ref string. Then collision-check `new_id` against the index.
2. **Snapshot the referrer set first.** Collect `{inref.source_uid for inref in
   index.in_refs.get(old_id, [])}` into a deduplicated set *before* any index mutation — the
   rename loop calls `index.upsert`, which rewrites `in_refs`, so iterating the live structure
   would skip or double-process entries. The renamed node's own uid is included if it
   self-references.
3. Read the node, set `id = new_id`, `kind = parse(new_id).kind`, append `old_id` to
   `deprecated_ids`. **Rewrite the renamed node's own `old_id` references too** — its
   `relations` `source`/`target`, and its membership `members`/`edges` — so a relation whose
   normalized `source` was `old_id` does not serialize a stale explicit `source: old_id` (it
   must again read as the container source). The node is one of the snapshotted referrers when
   it self-references; handle it via the same rewrite path.
4. `store.write_file(new)` first, then `store.delete_file(old)` if the path changed
   (crash-atomic ordering, matching the kernel's hardened rename).
5. For each *other* `referrer_uid` in the snapshot, load that referrer (`store.read_file` by its
   live id from `index.by_uid`), rewrite every `old_id` occurrence across its `relations`
   (`source`+`target`), membership `members`, and membership `edges` (`source`+`target`),
   `store.write_file` it, then `index.upsert` it.
6. `index.upsert` the renamed node.

This replaces the kernel's `_rewrite_inbound` whole-corpus scan with a targeted walk of the
known referrers. Both the renamed node and every referrer are written exactly once.

## 6. Core correctness invariant

The spec's promise is "incremental updates == fully rebuildable from the files." This is a
**tested property**:

> After any sequence of `Corpus` mutations, the live in-memory index must equal a fresh
> `Index.build(store.all_nodes())`.

Equality is defined over all four maps (`by_uid`, `id_to_uid`, `deprecated_to_uid`, `in_refs`).
The scalar maps compare directly; the **list-valued** structures (`out_refs`, `in_refs`) compare
as **normalized multisets**, not ordered lists — incremental insertion order differs from
rebuild scan order even when the index is semantically identical, so the property test sorts
each ref list by a stable key (e.g. `(ref, role, source_uid)`) before comparing. This directly
catches incremental-maintenance bugs — the main risk of the in-memory+incremental
choice.

## 7. Error handling

- Unresolved ref (`get` / `resolve`) → `RefError`.
- Identity collision (`add` / `rename`) → `CollisionError`.
- **Dangling edges are a normal state**, not an error: a relation whose target ref does not
  resolve (target not yet created, or deleted) is returned by **`outbound(existing_source)`** and
  **`dangling()`** with `target_uid = None`. `inbound` is keyed on the target's uid, so by
  construction it never surfaces edges to an unresolvable id. Graph queries never raise on a
  dangling *target*; they raise `RefError` only when the *input* `ref` itself does not resolve.

All error types are the existing `nodes.kernel.errors` classes — no new error types.

## 8. Testing strategy

- **`Index` unit tests:** resolution order (live id beats deprecated id); collision detection
  (both forms); `outbound` / `inbound` relations-only edges; dangling-target handling;
  `upsert` replace-safety and `remove` leave no stale map entries.
- **`Corpus` integration tests:** `add` / `get` / `rename` / `delete` round-trips; deprecated-id
  resolution after rename; collision-on-add; `delete` live-id-only behavior; rename rewrites
  every referrer (relations + membership members + membership edges) — these port up from the
  kernel's existing `Store` rename tests. Plus the cases the design tightened:
  - **renamed node's own relations** — a node whose outgoing relation had explicit
    `source == old_id` must, after rename, serialize that relation with the *container* source
    (no stale `source: old_id`).
  - **edge-source rename** — renaming an id used as a membership *edge source* (not just a
    target) must find and rewrite the containing structure node.
  - **multi-ref referrer** — a referrer that points at `old_id` from several positions is
    rewritten and written exactly once (snapshot/dedup).
  - **inbound across a deprecated id** — `inbound(new_id)` includes an edge still written as
    `old_id`.
  - **rename rejects a deprecated/unknown `old_id`** — `RefError`, no file written or deleted.
  - **delete leaves dangling inbound** — after deleting a target, `outbound(source)` reports the
    edge with `target_uid = None`, `dangling()` lists it, `inbound` on the deleted id raises
    `RefError`, and a fresh rebuild matches the live index (`remove` kept the referrer's `in_ref`).
- **Rebuild-equivalence property test (§6):** drive a sequence of mutations (add/rename/delete,
  including deletes that strand inbound refs), assert live index equals a fresh rebuild from disk.
- **Migration:** Plan 1's `Store` tests for `resolve` / collision / `rename` move up to target
  `Corpus`; `Store`'s own tests shrink to file mechanics. The existing suite stays green
  (adjusted for the relocated API), plus the new `Index` / `Corpus` / property tests.

## 9. Known deferrals (intentional)

Disk persistence of the index; full-text search; embeddings / similarity; public
membership-graph traversal queries; the TypeScript port. Each becomes its own later plan if a
consumer needs it.
